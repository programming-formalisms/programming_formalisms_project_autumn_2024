# Bacteria Simulation

To simulate bacterial movement in 2D space.

## About
Learners' project of the Programming Formalisms course of autumn 2024.
One way to model bacterial movement is the run and tumble model, where 'run' is going straight in a direction, and 'tumble' is picking a random direction. The 'run' lasts longer when a bacterium finds more and more nutrients (e.g. dissolved sugars), and lasts shorter when finding less and less nutrients. This model simulates bacteria doing the run and tumble to collect nutrient. Data will be vizialised regarding the bacteria lifespan.
