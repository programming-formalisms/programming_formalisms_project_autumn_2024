## Q: What is pair programming?

#### A: An agile software technique in which two programmers work together, with one acting as the driver (writing code) and the other as the navigator/observer.

## Q: How does a good pair behave? Describe what can be observed when pairing online

#### A: A good pair communicates effectively, maintain focus, and alternates roles regularly. In online pairing, they use collaborative tools.

## Q: When to switch roles? Give a procedure


#### A: Roles should switch regularly and at natural task boundaries. The navigator/observer can announce the switch, giving a brief summary of ongoing progress before taking the driver's role. 


## Q: What effects does pair programming have?

#### A: 
#### Pros:
- Knowledge sharing
- Thinking, solving problems together
- Focus, easier to stay focused when working in pairs
- Accuracy, constant code checking

#### Cons:
- More complexity
- Fatigue, common to take less brakes
- Different skill levels
- No alone time
- Increase development time
