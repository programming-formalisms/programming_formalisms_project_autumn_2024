| R2                  | Environment Initialization                  | The simulation must initialize a 2D space with user-defined dimensions and optional gradients or features.    | - Verify the 2D space initializes correctly with all defined properties (e.g., size, chemical gradient, obstacles). |
| R3                  | Random Movement                           | Bacteria must perform random motion by default (e.g., run-and-tumble dynamics).                              | - Verify that bacteria move randomly within the field.                                                           |
| R4                  | Chemotaxis Simulation                     | Bacteria should sense and move toward higher concentrations of a chemical gradient.                          | - Implement gradient sensing. - Confirm bacteria move toward higher concentrations of the chemical.              |
| R5                  | Interaction Between Bacteria              | Bacteria must interact through collisions or quorum sensing mechanisms if specified in settings.              | - Verify that bacteria respond to each other's presence (e.g., avoid overlapping or aggregate in groups).         |
| R6                  | Boundary Conditions                       | Define boundary behavior for bacteria, such as reflecting, wrapping, or stopping at edges.                   | - Confirm bacteria behave correctly at boundaries based on the specified condition.                               |
| R7                  | Simulation Step                           | The simulation must progress in discrete steps, updating bacterial positions and orientations.                | - Verify that bacterial positions and orientations update correctly with each simulation step.                    |
| R8                 | Pause and Resume Simulation               | Allow the simulation to be paused and resumed without restarting.                                            | - Verify that pausing stops updates and resuming continues from the paused state.                                 |

| R10                 | Restart Simulation                        | Allow restarting the simulation without closing the interface.                                               | - Confirm that restarting initializes the field and bacteria correctly while keeping the interface open.           |
| R11                  | Visual Display                            | The program must display a 2D field with bacteria and optional visual cues for chemical gradients or boundaries. | - Verify that the program opens a graphical window showing the bacteria's positions and relevant gradients.      |
| R12                 | Real-Time User Interaction                  | Allow users to interact with the simulation by placing bacteria, obstacles, or gradients during runtime.       | - Confirm that user interactions immediately reflect in the simulation without crashing.                             |
| R13                 | Path Visualization                          | Trace and display the paths taken by bacteria over time.                                                     | - Verify that paths are visualized correctly without overwhelming the display.                                       |
| R14                 | Statistical Analysis Tools                  | Provide built-in tools for analyzing simulation data, e.g., average speed, cluster size.                      | - Verify that summary statistics and visualizations (e.g., histograms) are accurate and match logged data.            |
| R15                | Data Logging                              | Log data on bacterial positions, orientations, and interactions for analysis.                                | - Verify that logs are created and updated correctly with relevant simulation data.                               |
